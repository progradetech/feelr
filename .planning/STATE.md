### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.
v1.1 pending decisions (from research):
- Azure Static Web Apps over App Service (static exports, lower cost)
- Cloudflare DNS as sole authority (required for Workers Custom Domains)
- Pre-build strategy for SWA (skip Oryx builder, use pnpm/turbo in CI)

v1.1 confirmed decisions:
- Cloudflare Free plan for DNS zone hosting (braden.ns + ruth.ns assigned)
- SSL/TLS Full mode for .dev HSTS compliance
- DNSSEC left disabled during initial delegation
